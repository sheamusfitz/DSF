# DSF
Simple python scripts for calculate dynamic structure factor in 2D systems
Two steps:
1. Run 'current_calc_XY.py'
2. After 'current_calc_XY.py' is done run 'current_corr_XY.py'
3. Result - 4 files: 
  'kabsmas.pickle'
  'wmas.pickle'
  'jlkw.pickle' (longitudinal current correlator)
  'jtkw.pickle' (transversal current correlator)
